/*Given a payment table, which is a part of DVD Rental Sample Database, with the following schema
Column       | Type                        | Modifiers
produce a result set for the report that shows a side-by-side comparison of the number and total amounts of payments made in Mike's and Jon's stores broken down by months.

The resulting data set should be ordered by month using natural order (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).

Note: You don't need to worry about the year component. Months are never repeated because the sample data set contains payment information only for one year.

The desired output for the report

month | total_count | total_amount | mike_count | mike_amount | jon_count | jon_amount*/

SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) as month,
count(payment_id) as total_count,
sum(amount) as total_amount,
count(payment_id) filter (where staff_id='1') as mike_count,
sum(amount) filter (where staff_id='1') as mike_amount,
count(payment_id) filter (where staff_id='2') as jon_count,
sum(amount) filter (where staff_id='2') as jon_amount
from payment group by(month) order by month
